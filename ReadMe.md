# 📊 Social Media Analytics Dashboard

This project analyzes social media user engagement across demographics and content consumption patterns.
Using Power BI, a three-page interactive dashboard was designed to uncover insights on:

Global engagement trends

Demographic-wise user behavior

Video content performance

The report helps identify who engages the most, where engagement is highest, and how video views convert into deeper interactions.
